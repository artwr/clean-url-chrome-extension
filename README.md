# clean-url-chrome-extension

A very simple extension to open links while removing URL parameters.

Because sometimes, I do not like to be tracked.

## Usage

You will need to download the folder and load it as a developer unpacked extension.

Right-click on a link and use the "Clean URL" context menu to open the link (with url parameters removed) in a new tab or a new incognito window.
